# OCRA_ControversialStimuli

Applying OCRA [1] to the Controverial Stimuli task and data [2]. 

Data: 

The model is trained on the original MNIST dataset and tested on the dataset provided by the authors in their reposiroy [3]. 

Model:



### Results

"The performance of the candidate MNIST (A) and CIFAR-10 (B) models in predicting the human responses to the entire stimulus set. Each dot marks
the correlation coefficient between the responses of one individual human participant and one model (Eq. 3). The vertical bars mark across-subject means
(¯rM). The gray dots mark the correlation between each participant’s responses and the mean response pattern of the other participants. The mean of the
gray dots (a black bar) is the lower bound of the noise ceiling. The dashed line (“best possible model”) marks the highest across-subject mean correlation
achievable by any single model.
